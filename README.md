# Album Scanner

This is a Java application that allows users to convert a library of image files - each being a photo of multiple physical photos (such as in an old photo album) - into multiple image files for each, scanning each physical photo in each image into a new image file. The application uses the OpenCV library for computer vision and image processing.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the application, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Build the project.
4. Run the application.

## Usage

The application provides a simple graphical user interface that allows users to select a folder containing the image files to be processed. Users can also specify the output folder where the processed image files will be saved.

Once the user has selected the input and output folders, they can click the "Process" button to start the conversion process. The application will analyze each input image file and create a new image file for each individual photo in the input image.

## Inspiration

Recently my parents' brought their old photo albums out of storage, with hundred of film photos from the 1980s-2000s. I thought if I can take a photo of each spread and scan process those photos to image files, that would be a nice gift.
